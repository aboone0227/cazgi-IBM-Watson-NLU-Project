Hi,  

I've reviewed your submission and wanted to share some comments
Unfortunately I submitted the review before submitting the comments and was not able to add the comments afterwards.

I hope you don't mind having them added to this file.


> I'm unable to assess your implementation of the 4 endpoints in https://github.com/aboone0227/cazgi-IBM-Watson-NLU-Project/blob/master/sentimentAnalyzeServer/sentimentAnalyzerServer.js as this file does not contain your updates (and you didn't submit the updated code by another means).
  I suggest you add, commit and push your changes to this file using git:
  
```
cd /home/project/cazgi-IBM-Watson-NLU-Project

git add sentimentAnalyzeServer/sentimentAnalyzerServer.js

git commit -m "updates to sentimentAnalyzerServer.js"

git push
````
Good luck!
